# Script Settings and Resources

# Data Import and Cleaning
## Download the three datasets you have access to on the UMN SQL server.

# Save them as employees_tbl, testscores_tbl, and offices_tbl
# Save them as employees.csv, testscores.csv., and offices.csv 

# Create a dataset called week13_tbl combining the data such that employees without test scores are removed. 
# You must do this with joins only. 
# Save this file as week13.csv (you can place this in out).



# Analysis
## using SQL calls alone, using data consisting only of employees that have test scores:

## Display the total number of managers.

## Display the total number of unique managers (i.e., unique by id number).

## Display a summary of the number of managers split by location, but only include those who were not originally hired as managers.

## Display the mean and standard deviation of number of years of employment split by performance level (bottom, middle, and top) - in addition to dplyr functions, you can use mean() and sd() for this task.

## Display each manager's location classification (urban vs. suburban), ID number, and test score, in alphabetical order by location type and then descending order of test score.
